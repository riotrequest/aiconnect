# PHP AI Connect
A quick PHP script that lets you generate content out of GPT-3. Tested and working. The script was generated by ChatGPT after much trial and error.

This is a quick script that I developed using ChatGPT.<br />
I've spent the last few days trying to get the AI to generate a working, usable, PHP script for me.<br />
This script is testing and working. It acts much like OpenAI's Playground but I left out the variables on purpose, instead choosing to let them be defined within the code itself.
