# PHP AI Connect
This is a quick script that I developed using ChatGPT.<br /><br />
I've spent the last few days trying to get the AI to generate a working, usable, PHP script for me.<br /><br />
This script is testing and working. It acts much like OpenAI's Playground but I left out the variables on purpose, instead choosing to let them be defined within the code itself.

It doesn't do streaming or anything fancy. Instead you give it an input and after a few seconds it provides you with an output. I've been testing article writing using it.<br /><br />
You'll see in the code that I gave it some extra commands to go along with the prompt. That's so I wouldn't have to manually type them in every time.
